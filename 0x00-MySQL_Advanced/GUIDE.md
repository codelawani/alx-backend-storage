Copy the docker run command I will show now

then paste and run anywhere in ur terminal

Now this will fail because I already created this container b4

So I go remove it first for illustration purposes

Now I try create it again

Basically the docker run command, will pull the container from the docker store/registry if u didn't have it b4 otherwise, it starts running it

So in my case, Im in otherwise :)

See how it runs it straight away :)

Note: You must have docker installed as well as the docker extension

I will link a resource to help with that

Moving on...
as u just saw. Upon running the container, it appears here

So I can now attach a shell to communicate with it

Now that I have the shell. I can acess mysql

the password in this case is the one used in the command

and.. walla

we now have access to it

So that's mostly it
But there may be some issues that arise when u try to run docker. I will do well to attach some help for that as well :)

Thank you ...
